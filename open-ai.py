instruction="how to make captions like this on your  phone or laptop I'll show you right now  first of all let's look at the result  we'll get you can make hundreds of  dollars with your phone just by doing  captions like this for example I was  found a customer who needed to cut his  vertical video and add captions the  hourly rate was 10 and the customer paid  170 dollars for 17 hours but the  interesting thing is that this work can  be done with the phone install the  capcat app on your phone and let's get  started and later in this video I'll  show you how to do it on the laptop  first you need to create a new project  select the videos you need go to the  workspace open the text item order  captions here you can choose the  language you speak in the video I'm  leaving it in English turn on identify  invalid Clips which will detect poses in  the video so you can quickly delay them  later start creating captions you won't  have to wait long it all happens in a  matter of seconds in ready-made captions  select the all poses press delete  confirm that's it all deposits in the  video have been removed this is an easy  way to save your time now you need to  edit the generated captions press batch  edit some phrases are very long they  need to be divided select the phrase  place the cursor where the division will  be and press the indent captions are  automatically divided  try to leave two or three words in each  caption you can live more words if  necessary some captions I make with one  word on which I wanna put emphasis let's  move on to the design of the captions  select the style item in the phone  sections you can choose one of the basic  fonts or add your own I downloaded the  Bold one from daphon.com it's 100 free  to use and does not require licenses in  capcat click on ADD font upload file  find the downloaded font on your phone  and add it to the program then select  the downloaded font it changes  immediately in the captions created  before now let's move on to the style  tab for captions I use white yellow and  green colors set the text size to 20.  after that select the glow item set the  black color intensity 65 range 55. now  click on the check mark at the top of  this menu and the basic style for these  captions is ready in the style menu turn  off apply to Auto captions now we can  edit each captions separately first you  can play with the size and position of  the captions short captions can be  increased in size some captions can be  lower or raised you can also add  rotation to some captions in some  phrases accents need to be made on the  main words to do this select the  captions highlight the desired word  change the color and increase the size  by 2-4 points repeat this with other  captions after that we can start  creating animations for the text select  the title go to the animation menu and  choose the animation you need at this  point I will let the standard zoom out  animation which will add Dynamics at the  very beginning of the video you can do  the same with some other titles don't be  afraid to experiment with different  animations for example beside the zoom  out animation I also add a loop  animation called jiggle you can design  the whole video like this and get a  great result but now I will show you a  few more useful features now I want to  repeat this animation to get this result  we need to perform a few simple actions  click on the required title turn on the  video and result at the end of the first  line pause and split the titles using  the split button highlight the first cut  part highlight the first line change the  color to green or yellow increase the  size by 4 coins repeat all of this with  the next line we get this result  hundreds of dollars with your phone to  make the result even better I will add  emojis to this title you can use basic  stickers that already in capcat or add  your own I download emojis from  emojipedia.org there are many free  emojis that you can quickly find and  upload to your phone click on the  stickers then click on this button and  select the required image on the screen  adjust the size and placement of the  Emoji on the timeline set when it should  appear and when it should disappear also  add a loop animation called scroll left  and now then multiply through the frame  you can also try different animation  options the main thing is to make the  animation fast repeat the process on the  other titles in the video in addition to  emojis you can add any other images this  can be simple photos or screenshots it  doesn't matter the main thing is that  they match the content of the video all  titles are ready now let's move on to an  equally important part of sound effects  sounds at atmosphere and Dynamics to the  video capcat has a good collection of  sound effects you can use the search to  find what you need and add sounds to  your favorites for this video I chose  several sounds at times when an emoji  appears on the screen we can add a  swoosh effect add it to the timeline  place it at the beginning of animation  and change the volume to 2030 and here's  the result  of dope I can make hundreds of dollars  you can also add your sounds to the  video for this I downloaded the free  cash register sound from pixaby.com to  add it go to sounds select the folder  icon and choose from the device from the  list click the downloaded sound and  click on the plus sign next to the sound  place the sound on the timeline and  change the volume to 30. listen was ten  dollars and great next place the sounds  without the video you can add various  types of sounds pop ding swoosh all of  this improves your video the main thing  is not to overdo it  that's it the video is ready export it  and you can post it on social networks  as you can see this can be done easily  and quickly on your phone using the  functions I have shown the most  important thing here is to show your  creativity and you will succeed but if  you prefer to use computer here's how  you can make these captions on it create  a new project import the videos sounds  and images you need it's not necessary  to add everything at once you can add  new files at any time if you need it  drag the video onto the timeline click  the text button Auto captions choose  your language and click create your  captions have appeared on the timeline  you can identify parts of the video with  pauses by looking at the captions track  cut them using the split tool or use the  keyboard shortcut Ctrl b or common plus  b right click on the frames with poses  and delete them you can also use the big  space key for this proceed to the  captions left click on the caption  select captions some phrases are very  long and they need to be split place the  cursor where the split will be and press  enter the captions are automatically  split try to leave two with rewards in  each caption but you can leave more  words if needed now go to the text tab  choose the font for the captions you can  choose a F1 from the basic capcat  presets or one of the system fonts I  downloaded the Bold font from daphon.com  is 100 free to use and doesn't require  any licenses choose the Bold font  set the text size to 20 choose the style  presses with white text and the black  outline we use white as the base color  and later in the video we will need  yellow and green colors enable the  Shadow the basic Shadow settings work  for us in the text menu turn off apply  to all so we can edit each caption  individually and the changes will not  affect other captions so now we are  editing each caption in division adjust  the size and position of the captions  this can be done in the position and  size menu in the text tab or you can  move the captions directly in the player  with the cursor you can enlarge short  captions some captions can be lowered or  erased you can also add rotation to some  captions I recommend choosing wallets  within -3 to 3 degrees in some captions  you can highlight keywords with a  different color to do this select the  caption highlight the desired word  change the color and increase the size  by 4 Points repeat with other captions  let's move on to animations here we have  in out and loop animation and animations  are animations for the appearance of an  object on the screen out animations are  for the object's exit Loop animations  are mostly looped and constantly  repeated for captions I often use in or  Loop animations for the first caption I  add zoom out animation which adds  Dynamics at the beginning of the video  for this caption we add the shake effect  using the loop animation jiggle try  adding different animations find what  you like and use them now let's make  separate highlighting for each word in  the caption click on the required  caption turn on the video equals when  the first word is spoken in the video  pause it and divide the caption using  the split function  do this after each work now select one  part and highlight the first word change  the color to yellow and increase the  size by 4 Points repeat with the other  words and here is what we got m equals  money you can do this with a few more  captions in the video to add more  visualization to the video I will add  images to the captions let's take the  basic stickers available in capcat drag  it onto the timeline resize it to the  size of the caption set it to the  desired position I also add a loop  animation jump to highlight the sticker  on the screen in keep that you can also  add your own cards or emojis I  downloaded an emoji from the website  mojipedia.org drag it onto the timeline  place it on the screen and add animation  everything is quickly and easy I'll add  some more Graphics to the captions  what's missing sound effects sounds are  an important part of such captions you  can use sounds from The capcat  Collection or add your own you can use  this search to find what you need  download the Sound and drag it into the  timeline at this point I add a swoosh  effect I set it at the beginning of the  animation I make the sound quieter  here's what we get as a result this cap  cut for this Emoji I want to download my  own sound add it to the timeline also  reduce the volume work on the sound  throughout the video and click export on  computer you can also
